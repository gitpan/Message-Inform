in sub message:
in close_match iteration using $instance_name
the $interval_time loop needs to only iterate over intevals that we have
entered over time, not all of them.


_handle_tick is called for every message, which could be very fast, and
right now, it iterates over all of the allocated instances every time.
That's kind of insane.  Optimize later.
